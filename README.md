# UGBA 147: Advanced Business Analytics

### Final Project

This repository contains my final project for UGBA 147 at UC Berkeley. The project involved using stock market data to build a model to predict how much to invest in certain stocks. The resulting model had an accuracy of 14%.

The main notebook for this project is `[notebooks/Project.ipynb](notebooks/Project.ipynb)`.
